This repository is a documentation of my personal journey in achieving the knowledge of software engineering with the main emphasis towards the domain of "Machine Learning".

## **What can you find in my journey?**

This journey will consists of the following:

1. Documentation of each module taken in **Software Engineering** program at **Code University of Applied Sciences** Berlin
2. The code from my projects through my study
3. Link to all possible Study Resources (Free and subscription based)

## **Vision and Mission**

My goal is to feed my curiosity through knowledge and explore all possibilities of applying it in real life projects to create good products that hopefully will be useful for many. Moreover, I feel like knowledge is useless if we can't share it. This is the main reason why I start this project.

Please consider that the learning steps in my documentation might be the best possible path for me, but not for you. Always do your own research before following anything from this project (Or in life!)!.

I am always up for discussing any point from my journey that might need an improvement or correction. If you want to discuss something, please don't hesitate to mail me at: nino.lindenberg@code.berlin.

## **From my future "Me":**

If you have read this much, I would like to thank you for your interest and I also want you to know that this project would probably not be possible in the future if it wasn't because of your (direct or indirect) participation.

I wish that my journey will give you an insight to your own interest and helps you find the path you are looking for.
